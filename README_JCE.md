## wolfCrypt JCE Provider

The wolfCrypt JCE Provider is currently set up to be compiled together into
the same JAR file as the normal wolfcrypt-jni classes.

The wolfCrypt JCE Provider is located in the following class:

    com.wolfssl.wolfcrypt.jce.provider

Compiling the JCE provider is done using the same instructions as
wolfcrypt-jni. Follow direction in the README.md for compiling the package.

This JCE provider has been tested on OSX (Oracle JVM), Linux (OpenJDK),
and Android platforms.

    MessageDigest Class
        MD5
        SHA-1
        SHA-256
        SHA-384
        SHA-512

    SecureRandom Class

### Example / Test Code
---------

Example code will be added in the near future. JUnit test code is located
under the "./src/test/java/com/wolfssl/provider/jce/test/" directory for
each wolfJCE engine class.

### JAR Code Signing
---------

The Oracle JDK/JVM requires that JCE providers who implement several of the
classes above be signed by a code signing certificate issued by Oracle.

Full details on obtaining a JCE Code Signing Certifciate can be found here:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/getcodesigningcertificate-361306.html

For instructions on signing the "wolfcrypt-jni.jar" file generated by the
ant build system, please see the main README.md included in this package.
